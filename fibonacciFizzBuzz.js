// Fibonacci's FizzBuzz

// The goal of this kata is two-fold:

// 1.) You must produce a fibonacci sequence in the form of an array, containing a number of items equal to the input provided.

// 2.) You must replace all numbers in the sequence divisible by 3 with Fizz, those divisible by 5 with Buzz, and those divisible by both 3 and 5 with FizzBuzz.

// For the sake of this kata, you can assume all input will be a positive integer.

// Solution:
let fibsFizzBuzz = n => {
    let result = [], [a,b] = [0,1];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++){
      [a,b] = [b, a + b];
      result.push(a % 15 === 0 ? 'FizzBuzz' : a % 3 === 0 ? 'Fizz' : a % 5 === 0 ? 'Buzz' : a);
    }
    return result;
}
