    A repository with coding challenges that I have completed.
    <br />
    If you are searching for solutions of coding challenges you have not solved, I strongly encourage you not to look at the solutions until you have tried your best to complete it or at least taken the time to think about your own approaches.

## Optimizations

I frequently go over my old code solutions to refactor and optimize it for efficiency or readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The best way to practice coding is by doing it. You can learn all about the theory behind programming, but in programming, there is always more to learn. Coding challenges offer a continuous way to practice and find areas you need to improve. By solving coding challenges, you will not only sharpen your problem-solving skills but also build upon the concepts you have learned and the way you structure your code.
