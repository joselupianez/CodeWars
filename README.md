  <h3 align="center">CodeWars Challenges</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A repository with CodeWars challenges (Katas) I have completed.
    <br />
    If you have not solved the challenge, I strongly encourage you not to look at the solutions until you have tried your best to complete it or at least taken the time to think about your own approaches.

## How It's Made:
Every week I decide on a category of Katas (such as Array, String, Algorithms, etc) that I wish to work on for the week. During the week I solve at least one Kata a day in the category chosen to sharpen my coding and problem-solving skills in that specific category.

### Tech Used:
[![JS][Javascript]][Javascript]

## Optimizations

I frequently go over my old code solutions to refactor and optimize it for efficiency or readability.

## Lessons Learned:

Coding challenges offer a continuous way to practice and improve your coding skills. By solving coding challenges, you will not only sharpen your problem-solving skills but also build upon the concepts you have learned and the way you structure your code.
